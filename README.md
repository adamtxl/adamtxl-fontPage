## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of my portfolio site up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

You need to have npm installed on your machine. npm is a package manager for JavaScript, and you can download it from [npmjs.com](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm).

### Installation

1. Clone the repo:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/adamtxl/adamtxl-fontPage.git
2. Navigate to the project directory:
  cd portfolio-site
3. Install NPM packages:
  npm install
4. Start the project:
  npm start
This will open up a preview of the portfolio in your default browser, watch for changes to core files, and live reload the browser when changes are saved.

Usage
After installation, you can start editing the HTML and CSS files in the dist directory to customize your portfolio. The src directory contains the source files for advanced customization.
